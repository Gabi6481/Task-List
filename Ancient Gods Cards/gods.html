              <h2>Thoth Egyptian God</h2>

              <p>
                He was widely known and worshiped throughout Egypt — his head
                was a bird’s head — and he was one of the earliest ancient
                Egyptian deities, called the Creator where they believed that
                Thoth laid the egg from which Ra was created.

              <h2>Amun Egyptian God</h2>

              <p>
                Amon is the god of the sun and fertility, and he is the hidden
                face of Ra, and it is always depicted in the form of a man who
                wears a crown from which two feathers come out, and the name of
                Amun means the inner, the unseen or the invisible, so the
                communication with him was only through prayer and solemnity,
                and the sincerity of man in his monologues is the only way for
                the god Amon, Therefore, he possessed great popularity,
                especially among the poor who possessed nothing but the
                communion of God and submission to him, at a time when the
                worship of deities is widespread by offering offerings and
                material. Amon was different from all other deities because his
                absence from the image and being invisible is only contacted
                spiritually, making his worship close to being monotheistic
                worship, so he became the only god and all other deities a
                picture of him and a reflection of him, and among the most
                famous titles of Amun Ra was the title “protector of the path.”
                After his merging and unification with Ra, he appeared in the
                image of the god Emin-Ra, and it became visible and hidden at
                the same time, apparent in the form of Ra, which is manifested
                in his servants in the form of the sun, and hidden, mysterious
                and separate from the world as Amon, and the correct
                pronunciation of the name of God is not Amon as it is known
                Rather, “Emine”, with the fraction tilted to open, hieroglyphs
                use only consonants.

              <h2>Osiris Egyptian God</h2>

              <p>
                Osiris was the god of life and fertility in the world, before
                his brother, the god “Set”, the evil god, killed him to become
                the god of the dead and the reckoning in the underworld. Osiris
                is represented in the form of a man on his head the white crown
                of Upper Egypt, and he has a false beard, and he holds a scepter
                in his hands, and it includes His arms crossed. He is the eldest
                son of the god of the earth Geb, and the goddess of heaven is
                Nut, and he is among the ninth of the Holy Heliopolis or the
                ninth, the title of king of the living, and the Lord of Love who
                remains kind and young forever, and the master of silence.
                Osiris is the only Ancient Egyptian deity who was sometimes
                referred to simply as “god.” This gives us an idea of his power
                and importance to the Ancient Egyptians Peace be upon you, O
                Osiris, Lord of eternity, king of the gods all, who has many
                names.

                Isis She is the goddess of motherhood and magic, the sister of
                the god Osiris and his faithful lover, who has become an example
                of love and loyalty. Isis is always represented in the image of
                a woman holding the throne on her head and in her hand the key
                to life. She was called the cosmic mother, and the mother of all
                creatures. She is the mother of the god Horus, who gave birth to
                her by the act of magic after she brought life back to her
                husband, Osiris, who conspired against his brother “Set”, the
                evil god and I said, so she gave birth to Horus to avenge his
                father. Isis is famous for her famous sentence, also from her

                has done, and Horus has been given many titles, such as Horus
                the Wise, the Savior, and the one in the highest. Horus granted
                his eye to his father in an attempt to restore life to him, and
                from that moment on, Eye of Horus was considered an important
                religious symbol for the ancient Egyptians, and they called it
                “the eye that sees everything”, and people took it as an amulet
                to protect themselves from evils, and they attached them to

                protection of Horus.

              <h2>Aten Egyptian God</h2>

              <p>
                During the Akhenaten period, The Aten was installed as the
                principal god of Egypt and the word “Aten” was the traditional
                name for the sun-disk itself and so the name of the god is often
                translated as “the Aten”. After the worship of Amun reached its
                climax, the sanctification of the sun spread and called it Aton,
                the god that King Akhenaten announced in his call for a new
                monotheistic religion. Aton is represented in the shape of the
                sun with its clear rays ending with human hands holding the key
                to life. While Atomism was not unknown before the time of
                Amenhotep IV, it was during his reign that the Aton gained great
                (even sole) prominence among the gods. But After the death of
                Akhenaten, Aten returned as one of the Egyptian deities, and his
                monotheistic vocation completely vanished, and from the titles
                of Aten: the heat emanating from the disk of the sun, Lord of
                the Horizons, which glistens in his horizon in his name, and
                finally the father of Ra who returned to us as Aton…

                with a cow’s head, and the cow here is a symbol of peace and
                love. It is called Ein Ra, which destroyed its enemies, and the
                name Hathor means the sanctuary of Horus, it is that which
                enters Horus and took care of him after the departure of his
                mother Isis to search for the remains of Osiris, so it is also
                considered a symbol of motherhood, and women often set an

                Nut is the goddess of heaven and the mother of Ra, one of the
                oldest and most important gods in the ancient Egyptian religion,
                as it is among the ninth of Heliopolis, meaning that it is among
                the nine deities involved at the beginning of creation. Nut is
                the sister of the god “Jab”, the god of the earth, and their
                father is the god “Show”, the god of the air, while their mother
                is the goddess “Tefnut”, the god of humidity and rain. Nut is
                embodied in the form of a star-studded woman, covering the world
                with her body from east to west, dubbed by the ancient Egyptians

                Geb is the god of the earth. He is represented in the form of a
                man whose color is green, and he is sometimes depicted as a man
                with a goose on his head. There is a belief in the ancient
                Egyptian religion that says that without Jeb’s marriage to Nut,
                life would not have existed, as well as that with their marriage
                they gave birth to all the deities as well as the Sun also, so
                Jeb is considered the father of the gods, and after that, “Shaw”
                the God of the air separated them to separate forever, As Nut
                Alia inhabited the sky, while Geb remained on the earth, people
                were blowing water and planting. He was responsible for
                everything that happens on the ground, from germination of crops
                to earthquakes and floods, and the ancient Egyptians had a
                childish belief that it was the laughs of Jeb that caused
                earthquakes and that his kindness and mercy made the lands grow.

              <h2>Ra Egyptian God</h2>

              <p>
                Ra he was the Ancient Egyptian sun god, The sun had a special
                place among the ancient Egyptians, they considered it the source
                of life, so they took it as a god and called it Ra, and he was
                the god of the sun and the creator of the universe, one of the
                most famous deities in the ancient Egyptian religion, as he
                heads the holy ninth, which includes the gods concerned with the
                process of beginning creation. Ancient Egyptians believed that
                Ra created himself, and his tears created humans also the
                ancient Egyptians believed that the setting of the sun means the
                beginning of the daily journey of Ra, in which he travels by his
                holy boat to the underworld every evening, to fight the forces
                of evil represented in a big snake called Apophis, and then
                returns to a brilliant triumph in the heights of the sky every
                morning on a new day. The ancient Egyptian is a sign of human
                resurrection, and also evidence of the god Ra’s victory over the
                forces of chaos and evil. Ra merged with several deities,
                including the god Amun, under the name “Amun-Ra.” Amun Ra was
                the invisible face of Ra. He also merged with the god Horus, to
                become Ra-Horakhti, when the north and south were unified. Where
                the cult of Ra was widespread in the north, and the worship of
                Horus is widespread in the south, so the priests unified the two
                gods to become one god under the name “Re-Hor-achti” which is
                represented in the form of a man with a falcon’s head (the god
                Horus), and he carries over Head of the sun disk symbol (god
                Ra).
