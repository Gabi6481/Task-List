        <h1 class="title">Ancient Egypt History</h1>
        <p>
          Ancient Egyptian civilization is considered one of the greatest
          civilizations on earth. generally given as 3100 BC, human activity in
          the Predynastic Period can be traced back many thousands of years
          before this date. The Sahara Desert used to be a green and fertile
          savannah, home to a nomadic population who hunted the wildlife they
          portrayed in rock drawings (petroglyphs). Archaeologists have also
          discovered that cattle-herders in Nabta Playa in the Western Desert
          built stone-circle calendars dating from 8000 BC.

        <h3>Ancient Egyptian Gods</h3>
        <p>
          Over the course of thousands of years, the Pharaonic civilization was
          closely related to religion, as historians considered it as one of the
          most important foundations of the establishment of Egyptian
          civilization, more than 5 thousand years ago, and one of the pillars
          of the founding and unification of the Egyptian state… The worship of
          the various Egyptian deities continued for more than three thousand
          years … that is, the symbols of the Egyptian deities were worshiped in
          a time frame that exceeds the age of the Egyptians condemning
          Christianity and Islam combined! Nearly 2,800 deities worshiped in
          Egypt with a different names, as symbols of all forces of nature.
